Certainly! Hereâ€™s an overview of Module 2 for your course:

### **Module 2 Overview: Database Integration**

**1. **Objective:**
   - Integrate the sensor data collection from Module 1 with a SQLite database to store and manage collected data.

**2. **Steps to Achieve:**

   **a. Design the Database:**
   - Determine the structure of the database. Typically, this involves creating tables to store sensor data, including fields for timestamp, temperature, humidity, etc.
   - Define the schema for the database, including table names, column names, and data types.

   **b. Implement Database Functions:**
   - **Database Creation:** Create a script to initialize the database and set up tables.
   - **Data Insertion:** Write functions to insert sensor data into the database. This involves connecting to the database, preparing SQL `INSERT` statements, and executing them.
   - **Data Retrieval:** Implement functions to query and retrieve data from the database. This can include fetching the latest data, querying data for specific time periods, etc.
   - **Data Management:** Implement additional features as needed, such as updating records or deleting old data.

   **c. Modify the Sensor Script:**
   - **Integration:** Update the sensor script from Module 1 to call the database functions. This involves saving sensor readings to the database periodically.
   - **Testing:** Ensure that data is correctly written to and retrieved from the database. Verify that the integration works smoothly with the sensor data collection process.

   **d. Testing and Validation:**
   - **Testing:** Test the complete workflow to ensure that data is collected, stored, and retrieved correctly. This involves running the sensor script and checking the database contents.
   - **Validation:** Validate that the data stored in the database is accurate and corresponds to the sensor readings.

   **e. Documentation:**
   - Document the database schema, functions, and any changes made to the sensor script.
   - Provide instructions on how to set up and use the database integration.

**3. **Deliverables:**
   - A working database schema for storing sensor data.
   - A script or module for database management (`db_manager`).
   - Updated sensor script that integrates with the database.
   - Documentation outlining the database setup, usage, and integration process.

**4. **Goals:**
   - Enable storage and management of sensor data using a SQLite database.
   - Ensure data integrity and ease of access for further analysis or visualization.

**5. **Considerations:**
   - Error handling: Implement robust error handling for database operations.
   - Performance: Optimize database operations for efficiency, especially if handling large amounts of data.
   - Security: Consider security aspects, such as data access and integrity.

This module will build upon the data collection capabilities from Module 1 and add persistence and management through a database, enhancing the overall functionality and usability of your project.

I will not be doing all of this as much of it doesn't seem right. I wouldn't want sql integration in the sensor script itself.
