Interfacing with DHT Sensor Using GPIO and OOP Principles:

    Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Interfacing with the DHT Sensor
    Creating a Sensor Interface Class
    Testing and Refactoring

Database Integration: Expand the sensor data logger project to store the collected data in a SQLite database instead of a text file, using Python's sqlite3 module. (Database handling)

Web Scraping and Data Logging: Learn web scraping basics by writing a Python script to extract data from a website (e.g., weather forecast) and log it into a database. Utilize requests for web scraping and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML. (Web scraping)

Basic Visualization: Use Python's matplotlib library to create simple plots and graphs from the data collected in the database (e.g., temperature trends over time). (Data visualization)

Interactive Web Dashboard: Build a basic web dashboard using Flask, displaying sensor data from the database in real-time with simple visualizations. Enhance the dashboard with Flask-SocketIO for real-time updates. (Web development)

Data Analysis with Pandas: Use Python's pandas library to perform data analysis on the collected sensor data stored in the database, such as calculating averages, trends, and correlations. (Data manipulation)

Introduction to APIs: Learn about APIs by integrating data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) into the web dashboard, displaying real-time weather information alongside sensor data. Use the requests module for API requests and JSON parsing. (API interaction)

Real-time Data Streaming and Visualization: Upgrade the web dashboard to display sensor data in real-time using WebSockets for communication between Raspberry Pi and the web interface. Use Flask-SocketIO for real-time updates. (Real-time data handling)

Introduction to Testing: Learn about unit testing by writing tests for the sensor data logger and web dashboard projects using Python's unittest module. Understand the importance of testing for ensuring code reliability and correctness.
