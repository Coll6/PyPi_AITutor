Information about DHT communication waveform.
Used https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/758/DHT11-Technical-Data-Sheet-Translated-Version-1143054.pdf
DHT-11 packet is 5 bytes in total.
<IntegerValue HumidityHigh 8bits>-<DecimalValue HumidityLow 8bits>-<IntegerValue TempHigh 8bits>-<DecimalValue TempLow 8bits>-<Checksum>
Checksum is calculated adding the first 4 bytes together. Byte two lower humidity reading is usually 0x00.
Communication is started when the MCU is pulled low. Data sheet says for at least 18ms but AI keeps suggesting 18us

Every bit is preceeded by a low signal. It seems that the length of the high values determine a 0 or a 1 value.
The low values seem to be consistent for the most part. It seems the high values matter most and should be focused on.
a 0 will have a high pulse roughly 26us-28us.
a 1 will have a high pulse roughly 70us.  
Ending signal will be a low as if starting another bit but will leave the line high can be checked if a high value is there after 70us.
Length of a packet seems to be roughly 22ms counting the initial low by the MCU.
